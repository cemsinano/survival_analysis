[CRAN Task View: Survival Analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html) contains further information on survival analysis R packages with brief information for each one.
 
Alternative models to be discovered to understand survival analysis basics: 

- Cox (Proportional Hazards) Regression
- Weibull Model
- Bayesian Survival Analysis
- Tree Structured Survival Models
- Kaplan-Meier(K-M)
- Frailty models

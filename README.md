# customer_churn

It is a document to discover different methods for Customer Churn Prediction. Here, I will try to summarize models and resources shortly.

Available tools and libraries on Python and R:
 
- [lifelines, Python](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Survival, R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf)
- [scikit-survival, Python](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-survival/)
- [Survivalstan, Python](https://pypi.org/project/survivalstan/)
- [Simsurv, R](https://github.com/sambrilleman/simsurv)
- [KMsurv, R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KMsurv/index.html)
 
Alternative models to be discovered to understand survival analysis basics: 

- Cox (Proportional Hazards) Regression
- Weibull Model
- Bayesian Survival Analysis
- Tree Structured Survival Models
